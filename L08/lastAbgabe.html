            strange grumbling noises that seem to be coming from just behind the closest snowcovered shrub. What would
            be the best course of action? <br>Will you turn around and run without looking back, or will you, like every
            horror movie character ever, satisfy your curiosity by looking for the origin of the noises?<br></br>Run or look?"
